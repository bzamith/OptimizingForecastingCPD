## Install

```
virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 env
source env/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
deactivate
```

## Data

You may check the pre-define dataset domains in `/src/dataset/`
In case you want to add a custom one, you'll have to update that file

All datasets must be time series (uni or multivariate), and contain the `Date` column.

## Run

```
source env/bin/activate
chmod +x run.sh

# Don't forget to activate the virtualenv, if you are using one!
# First, build the code:
./run.sh build

# Then, to run for Apple dataset (TCPD domain), without Hyper-Parameter Optimization:
./run.sh execute TCPD APPLE

# Same as above, but with Hyper-Parameter Tuning:
./run.sh execute TCPD APPLE HPO
```
